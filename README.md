### Main Code Created By [Logicguy1](https://github.com/logicguy1/Discord-Nitro-Generator-and-Checker)

### Prerequisites
You need to install python, that can be done [here](https://www.python.org).

## Install
```sh
# Windows:
py -3 -m pip install requests
py -3 -m pip install discord_webhook

# Unix
python3.8 -m pip install requests
python3.8 -m pip install discord_webhook
```
## Usage
Run the `main.py` file using `py -3 main.py` 
The code will show you two promps:
1. How many codes to generate 
2. If you want to use a discord webhook, if you dont know how to get a discord webhook url it is located at   
   ```channel settings » intergrations » webhooks » create webhook```  
   if you dont want to use a webhook simply leave this blank  

The code will start generatring and checking after that step
